# Rise - Claude Guide

## Deployment Targets

- Vercel production: `https://rise-production.vercel.app/`
- GitHub Pages docs shell: `https://heyitsmejosh.com/rise/`

Use the Vercel production URL for runtime/API validation.

## What This Project Is

Rise is a financial terminal app with:

- High-speed simulator UI (`src/App.jsx`)
- Prediction market feed and filters
- Map-first backdrop + overlays (`src/components/LiveMapBackdrop.jsx`)
- Tactical HUD styling pass (grid overlay + live status badge + neon map controls)
- Single serverless API entry (`api/gateway.js`) with handlers under `server/api/`

## Situation Monitor Data Sources

- Flights: `/api/flights`
- Traffic flow + nearby incidents: `/api/traffic`
- Construction/barrier incidents: `/api/incidents`
- Earthquakes: `/api/earthquakes`
- Global geopolitical events feed: `/api/events`
- Weather alerts: `/api/weather-alerts`

Notes:
- Map overlays include traffic/construction/seismic/global-event markers.
- Local overlays refresh by current map viewport center.
- Fallback markers are intentionally injected when upstream feeds are sparse, to avoid empty-city states.
- Predictions are shown only when a confident geographic anchor is inferred.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

App URL: `http://localhost:5173`

## Test + Build

```bash
npm test -- --run
npm run build
```

## Deployment Workflow

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
npm test -- --run
git add .
git commit -m "..."
git push origin main
```

If Vercel is connected to this repo with production branch `main`, pushing `main` triggers a production deployment.
If Hobby deploys fail with function-count errors, ensure endpoint logic stays in `server/api/` and only `api/gateway.js` is deployed as the runtime function.

## Billing / Upgrade

- Pricing modal offers `Free`, `Starter ($20)`, and `Pro ($50)`.
- Checkout endpoint is `POST /api/stripe?action=checkout` with `{ priceId }`.
- Allowed price IDs are controlled by:
  - `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_STARTER`
  - `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO`
  - `VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_ID_STARTER`
  - `VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO`
- Apple Pay is handled by Stripe Checkout on supported devices once domain verification is enabled in Stripe.

## Current Priorities

- Keep simulator and monitor responsive
- Keep API handlers small and test-covered
- Deduplicate logic before adding new features
- Preserve UI behavior unless explicitly requested
